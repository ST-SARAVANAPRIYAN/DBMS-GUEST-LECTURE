## ðŸ”„ Understanding Normalization

We discussed:
- **1NF:** Atomic attributes only
- **2NF:** Full functional dependency (no partial dependencies)
- **3NF:** No transitive dependencies

ðŸŽ¯ **Why Normalize?**
- Eliminates redundancy  
- Ensures data integrity  
- Improves performance and maintainability
